    <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">About DonateDirect</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        DonateDirect is a platform created to support communities that struggle with
        essential needs such as food, clothing, basic healthcare items, and education
        materials. With a simple design and clear purpose, our website helps donors
        contribute directly to families in need, especially in rural and low-income areas.
    </p>

    
    <h2 style="color:navy; margin-top:40px; text-align:center;">How DonateDirect Supports SDG 1 (No Poverty)</h2>

    <p>
        SDG 1 (No Poverty) focuses on eliminating poverty and ensuring every person
        has access to basic resources. DonateDirect strongly aligns with this goal by
        enabling people to contribute essential items such as food packets, notebooks,
        blankets, sanitary products, and first-aid materials.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many families in rural areas lack these basic necessities. Through our platform,
        donors can directly support these households, improving their daily lives and
        reducing the burden caused by limited resources.
    </p>

    <p>
        DonateDirect removes confusion from the donation process by clearly listing
        what items are needed. This makes helping easy, transparent, and direct,
        ensuring support reaches the people who truly need it.
    </p>

    <p>
        By focusing on real community needs, our project contributes to reducing poverty,
        strengthening rural support, and improving living conditions. Every donation moves
        vulnerable families one step closer to stability and dignity.
    </p>

        <h3 style="color:navy; margin-top:0;">Our Goal</h3>
        <p>
            DonateDirect aims to make donating simple, accessible, and impactful.
            Our goal is to create a continuous support system where donors can help
            families directly and consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to connect people with purpose, reduce poverty-related challenges,
            and support the mission of SDG 1 by ensuring that essential items reach
            communities that need them the most.
